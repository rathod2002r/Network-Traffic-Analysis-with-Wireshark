### ðŸŽ¥ 3. Demo Video Idea (Script Outline)
**Title:** *How to Capture and Analyze Network Traffic with Wireshark*  

1. **Intro (Voiceover):**  
   "In this video, weâ€™ll capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark to understand protocols and spot potential security issues."  

2. **Step 1 â€“ Install Wireshark:**  
   Show installation commands or Wireshark download page.  

3. **Step 2 â€“ Start Capture:**  
   Select the network interface, click **Start Capture**, generate web traffic.  

4. **Step 3 â€“ Stop and Save Capture:**  
   Save as `wireshark_capture.pcap`.  

5. **Step 4 â€“ Apply Filters:**  
   Demonstrate filters (`http`, `dns`, `tcp.port == 80`, `ip.addr == â€¦`).  

6. **Step 5 â€“ Analysis:**  
   Show protocol hierarchy, explain unencrypted HTTP headers, DNS queries, and encrypted HTTPS.  

7. **Closing Note:**  
   "Always capture traffic responsibly and only on networks you have permission to monitor."

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also **create a sample `.pcap` file** with mock packets (not real traffic, but simulated) so you can upload it as part of your deliverables?
